# **Repository** - ai
### This repo will be helpful in understanding AutoGen providing examples including prompts and agents for SAAS products, how AutoGen works, and diving into the functionality.

## Current Library Versions:
- memgpt: 0.2.5
- autogen: 0.2.0

## Current Issues:
- [ ] MemGPT has been updated recently and if we don't use `memgpt configure` to set the openai_key, then it won't work with OpenAI API.  I opened issue here: [https://github.com/tylerprogramming/ai/issues/1](https://github.com/cpacker/MemGPT/issues/568)

## Projects
1. **autogen_memgpt** - understanding integration of MemGPT into AutoGen as an AI Agent
2. **autogen_memgpt_lmstudio** - using a local llm to integrate MemGPT into AutoGen with a local server produced by LMStudio
3. **autogentest** - examples of basic usage of AutoGen
4. **autogen_functions** - learn how to use functions with AutoGen
5. **autogen_multiple_configs** - learn how to use multiple configurations in order to use multiple models with AutoGen
